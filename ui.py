    Structure your findings strictly as a JSON object. Use clear and descriptive keys.
    For example, if it's an invoice:
    {
      "document_type": "Invoice",
      "invoice_id": "INV-1234",
      "issue_date": "2024-01-15",
      "due_date": "2024-02-14",
      "issuer_name": "Supplier Ltd.",
      "issuer_address": "123 Supply St, Goods City, GC 54321",
      "customer_name": "Acme Corp",
      "customer_address": "456 Buyer Ave, Client Town, CT 12345",
      "line_items": [
        {"description": "Widget A", "quantity": 2, "unit_price": 50.00, "total": 100.00},
        {"description": "Service B", "quantity": 1, "unit_price": 50.75, "total": 50.75}
      ],
      "subtotal": 150.75,
      "tax_amount": 10.55,
      "total_amount": 161.30
    }
    Only return the JSON object, nothing else before or after it (no introductory text, no explanations, no markdown formatting like ```json).
    If the document doesn't contain easily extractable structured data, describe the document type and key topics found in the JSON object (e.g., {"document_type": "Research Paper", "title": "...", "authors": ["..."], "abstract_summary": "..."}).
    If no relevant information can be reliably extracted, return an empty JSON object {}.
